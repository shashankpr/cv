  details: "My work at Dozee involves building an automated machine learning pipeline for extraction of sensor signals into heart, breathing and movement signals and later, automating the prediction of sleep stages of an individual from these signals. Ultimately, we aim to quantify the sleep quality of an individual and help them improve their sleep quality. Currently employing various kinds of classification algorithms like SVM and Neural Network to accurately predict the sleep stages. The accuracy of the classifier has been validated against the results from the India's leading sleep research lab, NIMHANS."
